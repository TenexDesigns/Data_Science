WHAT IS A BAYESIAN NETWORK

Bayesian network a Bayesian network basically falls under the category of probabilistic graphical modeling (PGM)
also known as PGM technique that is used to compute uncertainties by using the concept of probability

A baseyian network is based on the concept of probabilty and they are represented using a Directed Acyclic Graph
 They are also called as belief or casula networks as they are used to model uncertainicties or unknown values by using DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS



WHAT IS A DIRECT ACYCLIC GRAPH
a directed acyclic graph is used to represent a Bayesian network
and like any other statistical graph it contains a set of nodes and links where
the links denote the relationship between the different nodes so take a


 1         2   -----Nodes
 |         |
 v         v
 |_________|
     |
     V
     3
     | <-------- Links 
     |
     V
     4
     
     
look at this diagram here you see a couple of nodes 1 2 3 4 .
The arrows directing from each of these nodes represent the
relationship between these nodes.
if you look at the figure you can see that number 3 is dependent on both number1 and no number 2 .
all right because youcan see links or you can see arrows directed towards no number 3 meaning
that no number 3 is dependent on 1 and 2 or you can also say that 1 in 2 are the
parent nodes of no number 3.
similarly number 4 is dependent on node number 3 which makes no number 4
the child of node number 3 and it's a
simple relationship that we all can
understand by just looking at the figure
